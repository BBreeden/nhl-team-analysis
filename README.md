A project in development that fetches and presents hockey team statistics for games that occur on the day.

//TODO
Make this readme better...
Fetch only the teams that are needed, not all of them. It is a waste of resources, obviously.
Output the results to a text file or compose an email... anything that isn't in the dumb logs...
